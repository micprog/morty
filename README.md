# Morty

_Come on, flip the pickle, Morty, you're not gonna regret it. The payoff is huge. I turned myself into a pickle, Morty!_

Morty reads SystemVerilog files and pickles them into a single file for easier handling. Optionally it allows to re-name modules with a common prefix or suffix. This allows for easier management of larger projects (they just become a single file). By making them unique they can also depend on different versions of the same dependency without namespace clashes.

## Installation

Morty is written in Rust. Get the latest stable Rust version:
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
Then install `morty` using `cargo`:
```
cargo install morty
```

## Example Usage

To prefix all modules and packages in `test/package.sv` and `test/package_import_2.sv` and files with `my_little_prefix_` do:
```
morty test/package.sv test/package_import_2.sv -p my_little_prefix_
```

Alternatively, if you want to pass more files, morty will also parse manifest files (as generated by `bender sources -f`). See [Bender](https://github.com/fabianschuiki/bender).
